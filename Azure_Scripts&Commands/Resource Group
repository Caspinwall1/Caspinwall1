This section introduces PowerShell scripts that can be used for the automation of resource group
management, as well as for quicker administration times. Please ensure that the Az module is installed,
as per the Technical Requirements section at the beginning of the chapter. Then, proceed as follows:
1. Create a new empty resource group. Define a location and name for the new resource group
to be deployed, as follows:
New-AzResourceGroup -Name RG01 -Location "West Europe"
2. Create another new empty resource group with tags. Define a location, a name, and tags for
the resource group, as follows:
$tags = @{"Tag1"="Value1"; "Tag2"="Value2"}
New-AzResourceGroup -Name RG02 -Location "West Europe" -Tag
$tags
