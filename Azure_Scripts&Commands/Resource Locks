Applying a Resource Lock to a Resource
In order to apply a lock to a resource, you will need to provide the name of the resource, its resource
type, and its resource group name, as in the following script:
New-AzResourceLock -LockLevel CanNotDelete -LockName DontDeleteProd
-ResourceName ProductionWebApp -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites
-ResourceGroupName ProdNorthEuropeRG
Now, let’s try the same for a resource group.
Applying a Resource Lock to a Resource Group
To lock a resource group, provide the name of the resource group and the type of lock to be applied
using the following script:
New-AzResourceLock -LockName LockDeleteQA -LockLevel CanNotDelete
-ResourceGroupName QualityAssuranceRG
This applies the resource lock to the resource group successfully.
Viewing Resource Locks in Effect
To get information about a lock, use the Get-AzResourceLock cmdlet. To get all locks in your
subscription, use the following command:
Get-AzResourceLock
